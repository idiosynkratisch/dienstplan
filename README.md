# dienstplan
 German language script for generating a schedule assigning weekly 2 hour shifts between 10am and 6pm.
 
 Use this by
 1. Let everyone who needs to take a shift fill in the form `Dienstplan-Formular.txt` generated by `dienstplan.generate_form()`. They have to fill in their name and a value between 0 and 2 for each time slot, 0 indicating that they are unavailable, 2 indicating a preference for that time slot.
 2. Collect the results in a folder. Run `skript.py`; it will ask you (in German) to specify the folder with the filled-in forms. For each person, it will then ask you how many shifts that person would maximally like to take.
 3. The best schedules will be put in `Best Plans.txt` in the format of the form, as well as in `Best Plans.json` in JSON. Plans are lists of 20 names, including `---` if it's not possible to fill all shifts with the people available based on the preference forms and maximum number of shifts.
 
 The best schedules are those maximally matching the preferences, as measured by the sum of the scores people gave to the time slots they have been assigned. Since ties are possible, there may be more than one, all are then included in the output, sorted by displaying those with minimum variance first.
 
# Known Bugs

There are many undocumented features that may or may not be fully implemented, for example changing the amount of shifts per week, and giving different preferences for each week in a given timespan.
